Task Description:
The task I performed was the design and development of an Interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of this task was to create a browser-based quiz system that allows users to test their knowledge on a set of questions and receive immediate feedback. This type of application is not only enjoyable but also a valuable learning tool, as it encourages participation and provides a structured way of evaluating knowledge. The quiz application was designed to display one question at a time, allow users to select an option, provide instant validation (correct or incorrect), and maintain a running score. At the end of the quiz, the user receives their final score along with a completion message. The application focuses on being lightweight, fast, and fully client-side, meaning it runs directly in the user’s browser without requiring any server backend. During the development of this task, several steps were taken. First, I structured the project into three main parts: the HTML file for the structure of the quiz, the CSS file for styling and presentation, and the JavaScript code for logic and interactivity. Second, I designed the user interface in a way that was simple yet visually appealing, ensuring that buttons, questions, and results were easy to understand. Finally, I integrated JavaScript functions to handle events such as selecting an option, submitting answers, validating correctness, tracking scores, and displaying results. This task provided a complete end-to-end experience of building an interactive front-end project, starting from idea to execution, while also reinforcing the concepts of DOM manipulation, event handling, and user experience design.

Tools Used:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used as the backbone of the project. It defined the structure of the quiz, including the container, question area, multiple-choice options, submit button, and result section.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to style the application and make it visually appealing. CSS handled layout, fonts, colors, and hover effects. It was responsible for creating a card-like quiz container, highlighting selected answers, and styling the submit button.
JavaScript: Handled the logic of the application. JavaScript controlled how questions were loaded, how answers were selected, how scores were calculated, and how the final result was displayed. Functions like loadQuestion(), selectOption(), and showFinalResult() were implemented to make the quiz dynamic and interactive.
Editor/Platform Used:
The project was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This editor was chosen because it is lightweight, fast, and comes with helpful extensions for web development. Features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools made the development process efficient. The application was tested directly in a web browser (Google Chrome) since HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all client-side technologies. Running the file locally allowed quick previews and improvements. 
Applicability of the Task:
The Interactive Quiz Application has several real-world applications:
Education: Teachers can use quizzes to test students in an interactive way. 
Corporate Training: Companies can adopt quizzes for employee training or compliance checks. 
Entertainment: Trivia or general knowledge quizzes can be used purely for fun.
Recruitment: Organizations can evaluate applicants’ knowledge using quizzes.
